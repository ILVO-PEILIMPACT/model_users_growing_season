Use SWAP-WOFOST together with data layers covering Flanders entirely to launch a simulation for your specific location / case. Specify the planting and harvest dates.

This model is the first version of SWAP-WOFOST adapted to Flemish conditions. 
The model was developed and is maintained by Wageningen University & Research. 
This version was prepared by ILVO in the context of the project PEILIMPACT.
